      "transcript": "1. What “Offboarding” Means at Capitec  At Capitec Bank, offboarding is not a single event (e.g. “close account”), but a controlled lifecycle transition where the bank terminates or restricts a client relationship while ensuring:  No unmanaged credit exposure  Regulatory compliance (FICA, NCA, POPIA, SARB prudential standards)  Consistent, fair client treatment  Data, funds, and obligations are lawfully resolved  There are two fundamentally different offboarding paths:  A. Client with NO active credit  B. Client WITH active credit (personal or business) ← this is the high-risk path  Your earlier risk statement correctly identifies that Path B is the real problem area.  2. Offboarding Triggers (How the Process Starts)  Offboarding at Capitec is trigger-driven, not voluntary in most cases.  Primary trigger categories 2.1 Client-initiated  Client requests account closure  Emigration / death / insolvency  Business closure (Business Bank)  2.2 Bank-initiated (risk-driven)  FICA non-compliance (expired or failed KYC)  Fraud or financial crime indicators  Sanctions / AML flags  Misuse of products  Reputational or regulatory risk  2.3 Credit-driven triggers  Persistent delinquency  Default or legal escalation  Debt review / sequestration  Credit agreement termination events  Key point: Once credit exists, offboarding is legally constrained. The bank cannot simply “exit” the client.  3. Client Segmentation Before Offboarding  Before any action, Capitec segments the client:  Dimension\tWhy it matters Product mix\tTransactional vs loan vs overdraft vs credit card Credit status\tPerforming / delinquent / default Legal status\tDebt review, deceased estate, business liquidation Risk flags\tFraud, AML, sanctions Portfolio\tPersonal Bank vs Business Bank  This segmentation determines what Capitec is legally allowed to do next.  4. Offboarding WITHOUT Credit (Low Complexity)  If the client has no active credit facilities:  Step-by-step  Balance settlement  Account must be zeroed (positive or negative)  Pending items cleared  Debits, stop orders, card transactions  Product closures  Cards, savings pockets, access channels  Data retention  Account closed but data retained per law  Relationship terminated  This path is clean, fast, and well-controlled.  5. Offboarding WITH Credit (High Risk, High Constraint)  This is where the real complexity and your identified risk live.  5.1 Core legal reality  Under South African law:  A credit agreement survives account closure  The bank must continue to service, collect, and administer the loan  The bank cannot orphan the client relationship  Therefore:  Capitec cannot “offboard” a credit client in the normal sense. It can only transition them into a restricted, credit-centric relationship state.  6. What Actually Happens: Managed Restriction Model  Instead of full exit, Capitec applies a Managed Exit / Restricted State (even if not formally named as such).  6.1 Transactional capability is reduced  Cards may be cancelled  Digital banking access restricted  Incoming funds may be limited or ring-fenced  6.2 Credit remains fully active  Loan continues under original contract  Statements must still be issued  Payment mechanisms must remain available  Collections, legal, or restructuring processes continue  6.3 Client is no longer “commercially active”  No upsell  No new products  No discretionary services  This creates a zombie relationship:  Not an active client, not fully exited.  7. Credit-Specific Exit Scenarios 7.1 Loan fully repaid  Credit agreement closes  Client becomes eligible for full offboarding  Normal closure process resumes  7.2 Legal resolution  Debt written off  Judgment settled  Insolvency finalised  Only after one of these events can Capitec fully terminate the relationship.  8. Data, Compliance, and Audit Controls  Even after offboarding:  Client data is retained per statutory timelines  Credit records remain reportable to bureaus  Audit trails must remain intact  Regulator access must be supporte",

                "content": "1. What “Offboarding” Means at Capitec  At Capitec Bank, offboarding is not a single event (e.g. “close account”), but a controlled lifecycle transition where the bank terminates or restricts a client relationship while ensuring:  No unmanaged credit exposure  Regulatory compliance (FICA, NCA, POPIA, SARB prudential standards)  Consistent, fair client treatment  Data, funds, and obligations are lawfully resolved  There are two fundamentally different offboarding paths:  A. Client with NO active credit  B. Client WITH active credit (personal or business) ← this is the high-risk path  Your earlier risk statement correctly identifies that Path B is the real problem area.  2. Offboarding Triggers (How the Process Starts)  Offboarding at Capitec is trigger-driven, not voluntary in most cases.  Primary trigger categories 2.1 Client-initiated  Client requests account closure  Emigration / death / insolvency  Business closure (Business Bank)  2.2 Bank-initiated (risk-driven)  FICA non-compliance (expired or failed KYC)  Fraud or financial crime indicators  Sanctions / AML flags  Misuse of products  Reputational or regulatory risk  2.3 Credit-driven triggers  Persistent delinquency  Default or legal escalation  Debt review / sequestration  Credit agreement termination events  Key point: Once credit exists, offboarding is legally constrained. The bank cannot simply “exit” the client.  3. Client Segmentation Before Offboarding  Before any action, Capitec segments the client:  Dimension\tWhy it matters Product mix\tTransactional vs loan vs overdraft vs credit card Credit status\tPerforming / delinquent / default Legal status\tDebt review, deceased estate, business liquidation Risk flags\tFraud, AML, sanctions Portfolio\tPersonal Bank vs Business Bank  This segmentation determines what Capitec is legally allowed to do next.  4. Offboarding WITHOUT Credit (Low Complexity)  If the client has no active credit facilities:  Step-by-step  Balance settlement  Account must be zeroed (positive or negative)  Pending items cleared  Debits, stop orders, card transactions  Product closures  Cards, savings pockets, access channels  Data retention  Account closed but data retained per law  Relationship terminated  This path is clean, fast, and well-controlled.  5. Offboarding WITH Credit (High Risk, High Constraint)  This is where the real complexity and your identified risk live.  5.1 Core legal reality  Under South African law:  A credit agreement survives account closure  The bank must continue to service, collect, and administer the loan  The bank cannot orphan the client relationship  Therefore:  Capitec cannot “offboard” a credit client in the normal sense. It can only transition them into a restricted, credit-centric relationship state.  6. What Actually Happens: Managed Restriction Model  Instead of full exit, Capitec applies a Managed Exit / Restricted State (even if not formally named as such).  6.1 Transactional capability is reduced  Cards may be cancelled  Digital banking access restricted  Incoming funds may be limited or ring-fenced  6.2 Credit remains fully active  Loan continues under original contract  Statements must still be issued  Payment mechanisms must remain available  Collections, legal, or restructuring processes continue  6.3 Client is no longer “commercially active”  No upsell  No new products  No discretionary services  This creates a zombie relationship:  Not an active client, not fully exited.  7. Credit-Specific Exit Scenarios 7.1 Loan fully repaid  Credit agreement closes  Client becomes eligible for full offboarding  Normal closure process resumes  7.2 Legal resolution  Debt written off  Judgment settled  Insolvency finalised  Only after one of these events can Capitec fully terminate the relationship.  8. Data, Compliance, and Audit Controls  Even after offboarding:  Client data is retained per statutory timelines  Credit records remain reportable to bureaus  Audit trails must remain intact  Regulator access must be supporte",
